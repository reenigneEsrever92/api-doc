Home for multiple Java projects that should make REST API documentation easy

:toc:

## Motivation
People use documentation to make (REST) APIs accessible by clients and customers.
Yet, I've always found it to be cumbersome and clunky to include it in different
projects. That might also be due to different methodologies used to drive
development of services that advertise their functionality through an API that is
supposed to be restishly.

So with in this project my goal is to provide flexible, yet solid ways, to include
API documentation in a project.
